# Weather-App
Website displaying weather data using API.

Purpose of this project was to practice the usage of APIs, async functions, and promises.
Also just general more Javascript practice. Previous projects haven't been commented because I thought those project wouldn't be seen, so now I'm practicing documenting my projects. So I may overcomment, as I don't have the experience yet to really filter out what information is only truly needed.
